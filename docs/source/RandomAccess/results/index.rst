====================================
RandomAccess FPGA Benchmark Results
====================================

The benchmark results are given divided by the used version of the benchmark, since internal changes in the benchmark code might lead to different performance results.
All performance measures are given in million update operations per second (MUOP/s) and the measurements were done with a data array of 4GB.
The measurements were executed 10 times and the best result is published.

The results and the used configuration is given in :numref:`tbl_randomaccess_2_2_results` and are also available as :download:`CSV <randomaccess-2-2.csv>`.
