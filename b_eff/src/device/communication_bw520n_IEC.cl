/**
 * This file contains two kernels "send" and "recv".
 * They are identical in their function except two differences:
 * - they use different channels for sending and receiving data
 * - "send" sends first a message and then receives,  "recv" does it the other way around
 *
 * The kernels are hardcoded to work with the Bittware 520N board that offers
 * 4 external channels.
 * The file might need to be adapted for the use with other boards!
