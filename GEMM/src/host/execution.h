The actual execution of the benchmark.
This method can be implemented in multiple *.cpp files. This header enables
simple exchange of the different calculation methods.

@param context OpenCL context used to create needed Buffers and queues
@param device The OpenCL device that is used to execute the benchmarks
@param program The OpenCL program containing the kernels
@param repetitions Number of times the kernels are executed
@param replications Number of times a kernel is replicated - may be used in
                    different ways depending on the implementation of this
                    method
@param dataSize The size of the data array that may be used for benchmark
                execution in number of items
@param blockSize Size of a block that is calculated by the kernel

@return The time measurements
