# Changelog

This file contains all changes made to the source code for each release.

## 1.6

#### Added:
- MPI + PCIe base implementations for Inte and Xilinx FPGAs

## 1.5

#### Changed:
- Refactored the code to support different execution kernels and data distributions
- Changed formatting of the output metrics

#### Added:
- CPU only implementation or diagonal and PQ data distribution
- FPGA kernel with communication via PCIe and MPI for diagonal and PQ distribution
- FPGA kernel with communication via external channels for PQ distribution


## 1.4

#### Changed:
- Ordering of FPGAs for diagonal transpose: Now the highest ranks will calculate the diagonal blocks instead of the lowest
- Provide execution example in scripts folder
- Host code now also aggregates the measurements from other MPI ranks

## 1.3

#### Added:
- Distributed matrix transpose kernel transpose_diagonal

#### Changed:
- Host code to support different data distribution schemes using the TransposeDataHandler class
- Support for kernel replications

#### Removed:
- Old non-distributed kernels transpose_default and transpose_optimized as well as host code support for both

## 1.2

#### Added:
- Base implementation tests are now build and linked with the unit test binary
- Support for custom kernel designs

## 1.1.1

#### Changed:
- Converted host code to new OO code

## 1.1

#### Added:
- Optimized kernel for Xilinx Vitis toolchain

## 1.0.1

#### Added:
- Support for Xilinx Vitis toolchain
